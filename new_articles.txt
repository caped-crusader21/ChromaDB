Microsoft’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped deliver $70.1 billion in sales and boosted profits by 18% for the January-March quarter, a dose of relief for investors during a turbulent time for the tech sector and U.S. economy.

The company reported quarterly net income of $25.8 billion, or $3.46 per share, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings of $3.22 a share.

The Redmond, Washington-based software maker posted revenue of $70.1 billion in the period, its third fiscal quarter, up 13% from the same period a year ago and also beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Microsoft to post revenue of $68.44 billion for the quarter.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credited cloud growth for its strong quarter. The company’s cloud unit posted revenue of $26.8 billion, compared with expectations of $26.17 billion.

“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” Nadella said in a statement.

The company also saw a 6% increase in revenue in its personal computing unit, which includes its laptop business and Xbox services.
